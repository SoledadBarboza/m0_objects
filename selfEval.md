# Self-Evaluation

- This final exercise encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I am interested in advancing.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is irregular, I will work on that to move faster.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember?
I would like to remember the syntax, and that whereas an Array generally represents a list of ordered, indexed values, an Object represents a collection of named values.
